        <p>The <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/core/Object3D.position" target="_blank" rel="external">position property of the Object3d class in threejs</a> will hold an instance of the Vector3 class, and setting the values of this will set the position of the origin of an object of interest. Sense the Object3d class is a base class of many objects in threejs such as <a href="/2018/05/04/threejs-mesh/">Mesh objects</a> and <a href="/2018/04/06/threejs-camera/">Cameras</a> just to name a few, what applys to the position property of an object3d instance  also applys to a whole lot of various objects that can be added to a scene object. Speaking of scene objects these too are based off of object3d, so the position property can be used to change the position of a whole scene relative to what is often referred to as world space.</p>
<p>The <a href="/2021/06/07/threejs-buffer-geometry-attributes-position/">position property of an instance of Buffer geometry</a> is a whole other topic of concern. When it comes to mutating the position attribute of buffer geometry that is a little more involved, however there are ways of using what there is to work with in the Vector3 class to change the various values for vertices in position attributes. However in this post I will for the most part be sticking to examples that just have to do with object3d based objects rather than the arrays of various attributes of geometry.</p>

<h2 id="The-position-property-of-the-object3d-class-and-what-to-know-first"><a href="#The-position-property-of-the-object3d-class-and-what-to-know-first" class="headerlink" title="The position property of the object3d class and what to know first"></a>The position property of the object3d class and what to know first</h2><p>This is a post on just the position property of the object3d class in the javaScript library known as threejs. So then this is not any kind of <a href="/2018/04/04/threejs-getting-started/">how to get started with threejs kind of a post</a> as well as with any additional skills that are also required beforehand that have to do with client side web development in general. </p>
<p>There are a whole lot of other topics that will branch off from the position property such as things that have to do with the Vector3 class to which the position property is an instance of. Also there is not just setting position but also orientation of objects so I might also need to touch base on the rotation property also in this post at least a little.</p>
<p>There is no way I will ever cover every little detail then. Still I often use these opening sections of posts to go over a few things that you might want to read up more on before continuing with the rest of this content.</p>

In this post I will be focusing mostly on features that have to do with setting position, but there is also checking out my post on the <a href="/2018/04/23/threejs-object3d/">object3d class in general</a>.</p>

This vector3 class as the name suggests stores the current state of a 3d Vector, and is also packed with a whole bunch of useful methods that have to do with the mutation of this kind of state. </p>
<p>When it comes to Vector3, or any Vector for that matter there is thinking in terms of the direction of the Vector, and what is often called unit length. I will be touching base on a lot of what this all means in this post of course, but you might still want to check out my <a href="/2018/04/15/threejs-vector3/">main post on the Vector3 class</a>.</p>

This is also the repository where I am parking all the other source code examples for the <a href="/categories/three-js/">many other posts on threejs</a> that I have written thus far over the years.</p>
<h2 id="1-Basic-examples-of-the-position-property-of-Object3d"><a href="#1-Basic-examples-of-the-position-property-of-Object3d" class="headerlink" title="1 - Basic examples of the position property of Object3d"></a>1 - Basic examples of the position property of Object3d</h2><p>To start things off, here are a few basic examples of the position property that involves just setting the position of a single mesh object as well as the camera that is used to render at least for starters. There are a whole lot of ways of doing this, and I will be outlining many of them here.</p>
<p>As with any threejs example I set up my scene object, camera, and renderer and when doing so I also often add a Grid helper to the scene as well if it is going to just be some simple example such as the ones in this section. I then create one or more mesh objects and when doing so I will need a geometry and a material for that. I will not be getting into all the options with that here of course as I have other posts on geometry and material options. So for these basic examples I will be just going with the normal material as well as built in geometry constructors such as the Box and Sphere geometry constructor functions.</p>

That is that I can just set the value of say the x property of the vector3 class instance of the position property to a desired value and be done with it. This can also be done with the various other properties of interest when it comes to the y and z axis as well.</p>

<p>This might be a great way to start, and also in many situations I do in fact still update positions this way. There is not just setting the value but also stepping out as well but I am not going to be getting into animation in this basic section.</p>
<p>This is a good start, however there are a whole lot of other ways of setting position of an object, so let’s look at a few more basic examples before moving on to some more advanced topics.</p>
<h3 id="1-2-Using-the-set-method-of-Vector3"><a href="#1-2-Using-the-set-method-of-Vector3" class="headerlink" title="1.2 - Using the set method of Vector3"></a>1.2 - Using the set method of Vector3</h3><p>The set method of the Vector3 instance would be another option to set position from just directly setting the properties of the object with the JavaScript assignment operator. With this method I can just call the set method off of the instance of Vector3 at the position property of say the mesh object and pass number literals for a desired fixed position of the mesh object. The same can be done with the camera as well as that is also an object3d based object.</p>

<p>The vector3 class is used a lot throughout the library. On top of using the set method to set object3d position, an instance of Vector3 can be used as a value to give to the <a href="/2021/05/13/threejs-object3d-lookat/">Object3d.lookAt method</a>. </p>
<p>Here I am making a clone of the position property of the mesh, and then using the add method of the copy of the Vector3 instance to translate the position for the camera to look at, making it a position that is slightly lower than the actual position of the mesh object.</p>
<h3 id="1-3-The-Copy-and-add-methods-of-vector3"><a href="#1-3-The-Copy-and-add-methods-of-vector3" class="headerlink" title="1.3 - The Copy, and add methods of vector3"></a>1.3 - The Copy, and add methods of vector3</h3><p>Often I might already have a Vector3 object and I would like to copy the state of that vector3 to the vector3 of the position property of an object. For these kinds of tasks there is the copy method of the Vector3 class that can be used to perform this kind of action. Also I often use the copy method along with many other methods to work with in the Vector3 class. </p>
<p>For example, say that I want to copy the value of one Vector3 to a mesh object, and then also do the same for a camera, but then add another vector3 value that will serve as delta values from the position so that the camera is positioned anyway from the mesh object. This kind of thing can be done with the copy and add methods like so.</p>

Once again I can use the copy method to copy the desired start point for all the mesh objects position property, and then I can call the lerp method after that. When doing so I will then just want to pass the end vector as the first argument, and then an alpha value in the 0 to 1 range. A value of zero will be the start point, 1 will be the end point, and any float value between 0 and 1 will be a point between the start and end point.</p>

For these kinds of situations there is the normalize method that will set the length of the vector to 1, but will preserve the direction of the vector. Once the unit length of the vector is one then I can just multiply one or more of the axis values by the desired vector unit length that is higher or lower than 1. If I just want to multiply all axis values by one single value there is the multiply scalar method that can be used to do so.</p>

In such situations there is setting position relative to a parent object, and then there is setting an object relative to what is called world space. Sense this is very much a blog post on the subject of the position property of Object3d based objects, I think I should have a section in this post in which I go over at least a few examples that have to do with setting the position of objects by way of both local and world space.</p>
<h3 id="2-1-Group-object-example-and-local-space"><a href="#2-1-Group-object-example-and-local-space" class="headerlink" title="2.1 - Group object example and local space"></a>2.1 - Group object example and local space</h3><p>There is not just setting the position of a single object, but also all the children of a parent object as well as the parent object as a whole. In other words the add method of the scene object is not just a method of the scene object, but yet another method of the Object3d class to which the scene object is another example of an object that is based off of the object 3d class. </p>
<p>Yes the scene object also has a position property and if desired that can be used as a way to change the position of a whole scene relative to what is often called world space. However for now when it comes to this section I will be going over an example that make use of the <a href="/2018/05/16/threejs-grouping-mesh-objects/">THREE.Group constructor</a> as a way to have a parent and child kind of situation with the position of objects.</p>

<p>In this example I am creating a group and then I am creating and positioning a whole bunch of mesh objects and adding them as children for the group. When doing so the values that I set for the mesh objects are relative to the group, and the values that I set for the group are relative to the scene object. The scene object is then relative to a final static world space.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-Get-World-Position-method"><a href="#2-2-Get-World-Position-method" class="headerlink" title="2.2 - Get World Position method"></a>2.2 - Get World Position method</h3><p>When adding a child object to a group the position of each child object will be relative to the parent object, and not that of world space. There are methods in the Object3d class to help get a world space relative position rather than a parent object relative position, namely <a href="/2021/05/25/threejs-object3d-get-world-position/">the get world position method </a> that will prove to be useful if I want to position an object relative to another object, without making it a child of that object.</p>
<p>To use this get world position method I need to create a new Vector3 to copy the world position to first. Then I just call the get world position method of the Object3d based object such as a group that I would like to get the world position of, passing the new vector3 object that will get the values copied to. After that I then have the world position of the object, I can then add an additional value from there to get the world space position that would be relative to the group object rather than the scene, or rather world space and a scene object can also have its x and y values alerted to something other than 0,0.</p>

<h2 id="3-Setting-Position-With-Curves"><a href="#3-Setting-Position-With-Curves" class="headerlink" title="3 - Setting Position With Curves"></a>3 - Setting Position With Curves</h2><p>As of late I am thinking that maybe the best way to go about setting the position of an object3d based object by way of some code rather than user input would be to look into the <a href="/2022/06/17/threejs-curve/">curve class</a>. This might be a great way to set position when it comes to video projects, but might also work well in games and so forth by creating new curves as needed. Anyway in this section I will not be getting into anything to advanced buy rather just touching base on the basics of creating a curve and then getting a vector3 object along that curve that can then be used with the copy method of the vector3 class to set position.</p>
<h3 id="3-1-Creating-a-Curve-and-using-the-get-point-method-along-with-the-copy-method-of-Vector3-to-set-position"><a href="#3-1-Creating-a-Curve-and-using-the-get-point-method-along-with-the-copy-method-of-Vector3-to-set-position" class="headerlink" title="3.1 - Creating a Curve and using the get point method along with the copy method of Vector3 to set position"></a>3.1 - Creating a Curve and using the get point method along with the copy method of Vector3 to set position</h3><p>In this example I am using a few helper methods that I made while working on my Frink beta world video project series. In the video project I am creating curves and using those curves to set the position of a camera along with cretaing random points in space along with these curves. However to get to the point here I am using one helper function that is just an abstraction of the <a href="/2022/10/21/threejs-curve-quadratic-bezier-curve3/">THREE.QuadraticBezierCurve3 method</a>, and another helper that calls that abstraction that allows for me to define the control point as a delta from the midpoint between the start and end points that are used to define the curve.</p>

<p>I then use these helpers to create the curve that I want at which point I can use it to get any point along the curve by using the get point method of the base curve class. The returned vector3 object can then be used to set the position of an object by just passing it as an argument to the copy method of the Vector3 class that is called off of the Vector3 object store at the position of the object3d based object that I would like to set to that given position.</p>

<h2 id="4-Basic-Deterministic-Animation-examples"><a href="#4-Basic-Deterministic-Animation-examples" class="headerlink" title="4 - Basic Deterministic Animation examples"></a>4 - Basic Deterministic Animation examples</h2><p>In order to really get a solid grasp on the subject of setting the position of object3d based objects in threejs one will want to work out a number of animations in which they are not just setting the position once, but a whole bunch of times over a length of time to create a kind of animation. When it comes to animation there are two general schools of thought that come to mind for me at least and that would be Deterministic, and Stochastic style animation. In other worlds there is having a Deterministic kind of animation where each frame over time is predicable, in other words think video rather than video game. Stochastic style animation is what I would often call the kinds of animations where randomness,and other factors such as user input are at play.</p>
<p>For this section I will be sticking to just a few examples of a kind of Deterministic style, saving the alternative style for some other post or section outside of this one.</p>
<h3 id="4-1-Just-moving-a-bunch-of-mesh-objects-on-the-x-axis-by-differing-rates"><a href="#4-1-Just-moving-a-bunch-of-mesh-objects-on-the-x-axis-by-differing-rates" class="headerlink" title="4.1 - Just moving a bunch of mesh objects on the x axis by differing rates"></a>4.1 - Just moving a bunch of mesh objects on the x axis by differing rates</h3><p>To start out with animation I have an example here where I now have an animation loop rather than just a single call of the render method of the webgl renderer. This is an animation loop example that I seem to keep copying and pasting from one example to another over and over again that allows for me to set differing values for a frames per second value, one of which will be used to set the target frame rate at which the update function is called, and the other can be used to set the frame rate. This allows for me to set a low update frame rate while still going by a higher frame rate update when it comes to movement. Regardless of how I go about adjusting these settings the aim here is to update everything just by a frame over max frame value, rather than all kinds of other factors that might be at play.</p>
<p>The main idea here with this one is to create a group of mesh objects and have them all move along the x axis between a min and max value. To set the x value for each mesh object I am multiplying a set max amount delta value from the start point, then multiplying that by a number that is the current index of the child mesh. I then pass the result of this to the THREE.MathUtils.euclideanModulo method of the math utils object, passing the max delta value as the second argument for this function.</p>
<p>The end result of all of this is then to end up with a whole bunch of mesh objects that are moving from a start x position to another position that is a max delta from that start position, but at differing rates, and having them wrap around.</p>

<h3 id="4-2-Lerp-method-animation-example"><a href="#4-2-Lerp-method-animation-example" class="headerlink" title="4.2 - Lerp method animation example"></a>4.2 - Lerp method animation example</h3><p>Now that I have a nice basic by frame over max frame animation example, I can now start to move into another example that makes use of many of the Vector3 class features that I wrote about in the basic section. One very useful method that I covered out of many others was the lerp method of the vector3 class which can be used in combination with the clone method as a great way to move an object back and from between a start and end vector.</p>
<p>So then for this animation example I will have a collection of mesh objects that I move between a start and end Vector with the Lerp method and the use of that method will be the center point of this specific example. I will however also make use of a number of other features of the vector3 class such as the add method, as well as some Math utils methods to helper make things more interesting.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The position property of the Object3d class is one feature of threejs that I find myself using all the time in projects, as the name suggests it is how to go about setting the current position of something in an over all project. The rotation property and the look at method of the object3d class is also of interest of course when it comes to setting the orientation of objects as well. There are also a whole lot of other features in threejs that are closely related to the position property also that I should maybe mention in this conclusion section when it comes to fuhrer reading topics related to this. One such feature that comes to mind right away is the <a href="/2021/05/18/threejs-raycaster/">Raycaster class</a>. If you are wondering how to go about getting a position on the surface of the geometry of a mesh object this raycaster class is a very helpful toll for that kind of thing.</p>
