        <p>One of the most important things to understand when making a <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> project, is working with a <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/cameras/PerspectiveCamera">perspective camera</a> which will be needed in order to draw a scene object with a renderer. There are other types of cameras to work with in three.js that are all based off the core <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/cameras/Camera">Camera Class</a>, but a perspective camera is the most common one that mimics the way the human eye sees the world, so it is the typical choice for most projects for this reason.</p>
<p>When creating an instance of a perspective camera it is a good idea to be aware of the values that are passed when calling the THREE.PerspectiveCamera constructor for the fist time that have to do with the creating of what might be called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewing_frustum">viewing frustum</a>. The values that are passed have to do with field of view, aspect ration, and the near and far render distance. It is also called for to know how to go about changing these values after creating an instance of the camera as it is not just a question of setting new values to a property of interest. </p>
<p>There are also things like knowing how to position a camera, and set the orientation of a camera, much of that has to do with the <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/core/Object3D">Object3D Class</a> class of which the base camera class is based off of. The Object3d class is a major class in threejs that is not just the base class for cameras, but also Mesh objects, Groups, and even a whole Scene object. So maybe getting into the object3d class in detail would be a bit off topic, but I should cover at least some basics with that, and maybe many other related topics in this post.</p>

        <p>If you want to make a <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> project you are going to want to know a thing or two about how to go about working with cameras. A Camera must be created with one of several constructor function options, once an instance of a camera is obtained it does not need to be added to the <a href="/2018/05/03/threejs-scene/">scene object</a>, although doing so might still generally be a good idea. However in any case at least one camera needs to be created that can be used with a <a href="/2018/11/24/threejs-webglrenderer">render method</a> in order to view anything in a scene.</p>
<p>In three.js there are a few cameras to work with, but typically you will want to work with a perspective camera most of the time, at least that is the one that I actually used in most projects thus far. A camera like many other objects in three.js inherits from the object3d class, which contains properties that can be used to set the position and orientation of the camera. In this post is about the camera class that is shared across all cameras, and can be thought of as a kind of home base for all content on cameras in three.js content on my site here at github pages.</p>

        <p>I have been wanting to write a series of posts on <a href="https://threejs.org/">three.js</a> for a while now, and I do not care to put it off any longer. I have fiddled with three.js in the past, but never really got into it, that is until now. I have enough experience with it to know that it helps making projects that involve 3d objects very easy, yet it is still something that takes a significant investment of time to get fairly solid with. Also there is not just what there is to know about the various feature of the library, but also what there is to known when it comes to working with 3d in general. For example when it comes to really getting into 3d at some point sooner or later I am going to want to also get into using blender as a way to go about making external files that I can then load into a scene.</p>
<p>Also three.js is one of those javaScript projects that is just plain awesome. Working with solid geometric space is one of the main reasons why I got into programming in the first place, so of course I need to write about this one, how can I not? So this will be a getting started post, that will kick off at least a first few <a href="/categories/three-js/">additional posts</a> on this subject, and I can see it going beyond that easy.</p>

    </h1>

    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="text">
      
        <p>These days there are a ton of options for scripting http requests with javaScript when it comes to modern native options like <a href="/2018/03/27/js-fetch/">fetch</a>, as well as popular user space options like <a href="/2018/01/10/nodejs-axios/">axios</a> that seems to be a popular solution for this sort of thing. Many developers go so far as to make there own http clients themselves when it comes to yet another option, but even then a native method of one sort or another will have to be used in order to do so. There is using a modern browser built in feature like fetch, but I would still go with the old fashion tired yet true <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest">XMLHttprequest</a> for these tasks in many simple pet projects at least. </p>
<p>It does have it’s draw backs, compared to more modern solutions, but it is not that hard to quickly make a solution that makes use of more modern javaScript features like promises. It is true however that if I am going to start to invest a great deal of time into making my own http client, I should probably stop and take another look at where there is in terms of user space options for http clients. There are many great solutions out there all ready and I am not sure if I really need to be yet another developer inventing the wheel again by making yet another http client.</p>
<p>Still if I do choose to make my own custom tailored http client I will most likely use XMLHttpRequest as a way of making the request. Often I just go with it for examples where I just need to make a request for an example when working out a simple client system for an examples that has to do with a back end framework, or something to that effect as to not complicated the process any father than it needs to. In this post then I will be going over some very basic use case examples of the XMLHttpRequest method, as well as any additional topics that might come up when using the method.</p>

    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="article-entry" itemprop="text">
      
        <p>In late specs of client side javaScript there is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">fetch</a> method that is a way of making http requests in browser that is introduced in the <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/">whatwg living standard</a> . It is like the tired yet true <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest">XMLHttpRequest</a> method, but may prove to be a little easier to use, and returns a promise out of the box. However one draw back might be browser support for older platforms, depending on the situation with that the fetch method might have to be polyfilled, and is thus not necessary a native replacement for user space http clients like <a href="https://github.com/axios/axios">axios</a>.</p>
<p>So then the js fetch method makes use of promises, and provides an updated <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response">response api</a> for better handling common tasks like parsing json to a workable object which is a nice feature. So in many respects it is a little more user friendly compared to the tired yet true XMLHttpRequest method that would need to be used with much additional javaScript code around it to end up with similar functionality. It might still be a smarter play to go with a user space option that makes use of XMLhttpRequest to provide the same functionality still tough, at least that is what I would do more often then not.</p>
<p>So the fetch native client side javaScript method is like a browser built in modern http client. However because fetch is still a new feature relative to XMLhttprequest at least, it might be to soon to regard it as a replacement for a user space http client. However the fetch method can be added to older platforms by making use of a <a href="https://github.com/github/fetch">polyfill</a> for the fetch method. Still in my projects in generally prefer to use a user space http client, or the tired yet true XMLHttprequest method.</p>
<p>In any case the fetch method is still without question a feature in modern browsers that is worth a moment of my time to write at least one post on the subject. I have done so all ready with <a href="/2018/03/28/js-xmlhttprequest/">XMLHttpRequest</a>, and <a href="/2018/01/10/nodejs-axios/">axios</a> after all.</p>
