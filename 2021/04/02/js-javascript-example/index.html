        <p>Some may say that a good way to <a href="/2018/11/27/js-getting-started/">learn javaScript</a>, or any programing language is to study the language itself, as well as various libraries that are written in the language. However learning javaScript is a lot like learning English, where learning the language itself is just a way to gain a kind of literacy. Becoming literate of a language is great, but that alone by itself is not going to help me creating something useful, entertaining, or at least interesting. In order to really move forward with a language the real way to learn would be to apply a working knowledge of a language to make some kind of project. When it comes to English that would be doing a little writing, however when it comes to javaScript that would me making some actual projects, and functioning code examples. Simply put there is learning by reading a blog post such as this one that you are reading right now, and if course that is great, but it is no replacement for learning by doing.</p>
<p>So then maybe the best way to go about learning javaScript would be to just start making some fun, or useful <a href="https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/javascript-examples.php" target="_blank" rel="external">javaScript examples</a> that you can start to actually play with, or use to help solve some kind of problem, or at least do something that is an interesting taking point to say the least.</p>
<p>In this post I will be briefly writing about and linking to each of my javaScript example posts where I am just writing about a little code that constitutes some kind of simple javaScript project. Many of these javaScript examples are modules that will just provide one little feature of a game, or some kind of reusable function that could be part of an over all larger framework. However others are more or less almost full working applications actually. </p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h3 id="1-1-An-angles-module"><a href="#1-1-An-angles-module" class="headerlink" title="1.1 - An angles module"></a>1.1 - <a href="/2021/04/16/js-javascript-example-angles-module/">An angles module</a></h3><p>I often run into all kinds of problems that have to do with angles. I have found, or made solutions for many of these problems, but it would maybe be a good idea to have a stand alone module with some, if not all of these methods as they come up. For example there is figuring out what direction a current angle should change to face a target angle, when doing so there are two angles and two directions, but it would be nice to know which way would be faster. That is just one of many little things that will come up with angles, and this module aims to help address at least some of them.</p>
<h3 id="1-2-Attack-wave-control-system"><a href="#1-2-Attack-wave-control-system" class="headerlink" title="1.2 - Attack wave control system"></a>1.2 - <a href="/2021/03/31/js-javascript-example-attack-wave-control-system">Attack wave control system</a></h3><p>First off I have an attack wave control system that I might use in one or more canvas games, when it comes to my collection of canvas examples, and any other similar future project that revolves around the canvas element or some kind of game framework. The goal with this javaScript example was not to make a full, complete game, but is was to create a way to control the flow of waves of enemies units coming into a game world area. </p>
<p>There are many games that follow a kind of system where a period of time goes by, and a wave of enemies enters a game world area that must be completely destroyed. Many of them are a little fun, and addictive, so having a system like this worked out is a good first step for making a few games that make use of this.</p>
<h3 id="1-3-Basic-game-about-eating-Eggs-but-not-bombs"><a href="#1-3-Basic-game-about-eating-Eggs-but-not-bombs" class="headerlink" title="1.3 - Basic game about eating Eggs, but not bombs"></a>1.3 - <a href="/2021/04/15/js-javascript-example-basic-game-egg-eater/">Basic game about eating Eggs, but not bombs</a></h3><p>This is a simple game prototype idea that came to mind that I put together in a single day. It is a game where a bunch of display objects will spawn in one area of a canvas, and then move to another display object in the canvas that are of two kinds of types. One type of display object is will represent an egg, while the other will represent a bomb. When the player clicks and holds down on the canvas the player character object will begin eating whatever is thrown at it, eggs will result in a gain of score, while a bomb will result in game over.</p>
<h3 id="1-4-A-canvas-module"><a href="#1-4-A-canvas-module" class="headerlink" title="1.4 - A canvas module"></a>1.4 - <a href="/2021/08/27/js-javascript-example-canvas-module/">A canvas module</a></h3><p>I make a lot of projects that make use of canvas elements, in fact I have <a href="/2020/03/23/canvas-example/">another post like this one that is a post linking to all of the various canvas project prototype examples</a> that I have made thus far. Well at least most of them anyway. Anyway one thing that I have got tired of when it comes to making a whole bunch of vanilla javaScript canvas projects was wasting time making what is essentially the same code over and over again when it comes to some basic features that I would like to have when working with canvas elements. SO in this example I worked out a basic canvas module that contains many features that I would want to have in such a module such as layering, and drawing an array of points to the canvas.</p>
<h3 id="1-5-Digital-Art-invaders"><a href="#1-5-Digital-Art-invaders" class="headerlink" title="1.5 - Digital Art invaders"></a>1.5 - <a href="/2022/01/17/js-javascript-example-digital-art-invaders/">Digital Art invaders</a></h3><p>This is the third digital art project that I have made while experiment with a whole new thought process that has to do with plaining out that the core of an idea is and finish that idea in just a few days. The general idea here is to have a bunch of fixed units that will spawn at the center of the canvas, and a bunch of other invading units that spawn from outside of the canvas and move to the center to attack these fixed units. Speaking of units some additional things that I worked out in this example is a new object pool library, as well as a system on top of that that is used to create and manage units.</p>
<h3 id="1-6-Digital-Art-object-pool-reduce"><a href="#1-6-Digital-Art-object-pool-reduce" class="headerlink" title="1.6 - Digital Art object pool reduce"></a>1.6 - <a href="/2021/12/31/js-javascript-example-digital-art-reduce-pool">Digital Art object pool reduce</a></h3><p>This is the first of what might be a few digital art javaScript example projects, this one is about an object pool that will reduce into a single active display object. The general idea came to me while I was editing my post on the array reduce method in core javaScript. Anyway the real goal with this example is not to just create another example, but also start a whole new process of how to go about creating and maintaining these examples. That is to focus on what a Minimal Viable Product is, or some other terms that means the same thing such as a Core Idea. In additional to focusing on just the basic core idea of what a project is there is also keeping revisions fine grain, and spacing things out so the core idea will be done in just a few days, or even just a few hours. If all goes well this will not just be another example, but the start of a new process that I will continue to do as I work on more examples, and fix up older ones.</p>
<h3 id="1-7-Digital-Art-Unsteady-Stars"><a href="#1-7-Digital-Art-Unsteady-Stars" class="headerlink" title="1.7 - Digital Art Unsteady Stars"></a>1.7 - <a href="/2022/01/10/js-javascript-example-digital-art-unsteady-stars">Digital Art Unsteady Stars</a></h3><p>Continuing with the digital art series of javaScript examples, this project involves some of the features that I started out with in the first digital art project but I also explored an idea that I had when it comes to working with an array of points. When it comes to my canvas example collection of posts I made one canvas example post that has to do with create stars using a standard that has to do with a collection of points, I also have another canvas example that has to do with a draw points method that is used to draw the stars used in that module. With that said in this example I expanded on the source code of the stars module that I made for that old canvas example post my adding a new function that creates and returns a so called unsteady star object. The unsteady star object is not juts a collection of points, but also additional properties that have to do with how to go about mutating that collection of points.</p>
<h3 id="1-8-A-Draw-points-canvas-method"><a href="#1-8-A-Draw-points-canvas-method" class="headerlink" title="1.8 - A Draw points canvas method"></a>1.8 - <a href="/2021/04/01/js-javascript-example-draw-points/">A Draw points canvas method</a></h3><p>This is a javaScript example where I worked out a system for drawing a collection of points rather than just one point to a canvas element. When it comes to drawing a single point to a canvas there is often just using the canvas arc method to do so, or doing something that involves drawing a box, and then lines from each corner. However there is also having a collection of points, and how to go about drawing a line with this collection of points. Having a simple system where it is just a single array of points is easy enough, but things get at least a little more involved when it is a situation in which I want to draw a few lines, where some of them will be closed off into shapes, and others will be just lines.</p>
<h3 id="1-9-An-exp-point-system"><a href="#1-9-An-exp-point-system" class="headerlink" title="1.9 - An exp point system"></a>1.9 - <a href="/2020/04/27/js-javascript-example-exp-system/">An exp point system</a></h3><p>This is my first attempt at making a module, reusable experience point system that I can take with me from one project to the next. I have used this system in a few of my canvas examples, but I am not happy with it. Still I would say that I have managed to get a few things solid with this system to say the least. I think that a good experience point system should provide at least two pure functions that will both return a kind of standard level object. One pure function where the experience points are know, but the level is not, and another that will work where the level is known, but the experience point values are not known.</p>
<h3 id="1-10-Fizz-buzz"><a href="#1-10-Fizz-buzz" class="headerlink" title="1.10 - Fizz buzz"></a>1.10 - <a href="/2020/06/26/js-javascript-example-fizzbuzz">Fizz buzz</a></h3><p>Often I need to make the same thing over an over again at least a few times before I even begin to get a clear idea as to how it is that I want to design a system. When I first start working out a prototype for an idea on something I often get a basic work proof of that idea, but often there is a great deal wrong with it. So I then make a new system where I end up making the whole thing all over again, but now a slightly better system that does not have all the problems of the first prototype. This process then often repeats at least a few times until I get something that is fairly solid, or at least good enough. This fizzbuzz javaScript example is then an exercise of this sort of thing on a micro scale with a very simple idea, rather than a complex module, or full feature application of some kind.</p>
<h3 id="1-11-A-game-framework-example"><a href="#1-11-A-game-framework-example" class="headerlink" title="1.11 - A game framework example"></a>1.11 - <a href="/2021/09/03/js-javascript-example-game-framework/">A game framework example</a></h3><p>This JavaScript example is more of a major javaScript project actually as the aim here is to make a basic game framework. I just wanted to have a few features for this thing, but even then there is a lot to it as even a basic game framework is often not so basic.</p>
<h3 id="1-12-Grid-Game-Unit-Movement"><a href="#1-12-Grid-Game-Unit-Movement" class="headerlink" title="1.12 - Grid Game Unit Movement"></a>1.12 - <a href="/2020/08/11/js-javascript-example-grid-game-unit-movement/">Grid Game Unit Movement</a></h3><p>In this example I have a grid and I am working out some basic logic when it comes to moving those units around in the grid. There is a bit to it actually when it comes to making a system for this sort of thing from the ground up. However what is also great about it is that it is not so hard to get something working, and once I have a basic system for the kinds of games that I have in mind I can use it to not just make one game but a few taking this system with me to each new project. However as of this writing this one is still a work in progress that I have not put as much time into as I would have liked to. I do have a lot of other things going on that get in the way of me working much of this stuff out.</p>
<h3 id="1-13-Grid-Module"><a href="#1-13-Grid-Module" class="headerlink" title="1.13 - Grid Module"></a>1.13 - <a href="/2021/08/20/js-javascript-example-grid-module/">Grid Module</a></h3><p>In this post I am just going over the source code of a basic grid module.</p>
<h3 id="1-14-idle-game-of-a-simple-mine-theme"><a href="#1-14-idle-game-of-a-simple-mine-theme" class="headerlink" title="1.14 - idle game of a simple mine theme"></a>1.14 - <a href="/2021/07/16/js-javascript-example-idle-game-simple-mine/">idle game of a simple mine theme</a></h3><p>This is a starting point for a simple idle game idea that is just another basic mine type theme. The general idea is that it will have some kind of space theme, and involve ships going back and form from planets back to a home base of sorts. This seems to me a common theme when it comes to these kinds of games as I see a lot of them on the open web.</p>
<h3 id="1-15-wild-plant-grid-idle-game"><a href="#1-15-wild-plant-grid-idle-game" class="headerlink" title="1.15 -  wild plant grid idle game"></a>1.15 -  <a href="/2021/08/13/js-javascript-example-idle-game-wild-plant-grid/">wild plant grid idle game</a></h3><p>This is another idle game prototype that I might work on more at one point or another. The idea was to just have a grid of cells in which plants grow.</p>
<h3 id="1-16-Item-probability"><a href="#1-16-Item-probability" class="headerlink" title="1.16 - Item probability"></a>1.16 - <a href="/2021/12/24/js-javascript-example-item-probability/">Item probability</a></h3><p>When making a rpg type game of one kind or another such as my turn based RPG that is one of the many javaScript examples in this list, there is a need to have some kind of system that will be used to set the probability of certain classes of items. That is that there are many games that have a kind of class system for items where such as common, rare, epic, ect so with that said this javaScript example aims to be a system that is used to manage what the occurrence of such classes of items is when it comes to drops when enemies are killed, or the changes of such items spawning in certain locations.</p>
<h3 id="1-17-A-log-once-method"><a href="#1-17-A-log-once-method" class="headerlink" title="1.17 - A log once method"></a>1.17 - <a href="/2021/03/29/js-javascript-example-log-once/">A log once method</a></h3><p>One thing that I would like to have as part of a basic utility library that I take with me from one project to another is a log once, or call once type method. When first starting out with the basic of debugging there is using the console.log method to log things out to the javaScriot console as they happen. I do not think that this is such a bad way to go about debugging, and I still find myself doing it, however there are some things to gain from starting to use my own system for logging things that are going on.</p>
<h3 id="1-18-Simple-map-system-for-selecting-a-level-in-a-game"><a href="#1-18-Simple-map-system-for-selecting-a-level-in-a-game" class="headerlink" title="1.18 - Simple map system for selecting a level in a game"></a>1.18 - <a href="/2021/04/06/js-javascript-example-map-system-simple/">Simple map system for selecting a level in a game</a></h3><p>In this example I am working out a simple map system that will set some options for a main game state create method. In other words this is a simple system for having a collection of display objects in a canvas where each display object is for a level in a game, when the player clicks on one of these display objects they then progress to another state of the application that will be used to set additional settings, or progress directly to the game state. The display object in the map contains properties that will be passed to the game create method that will set up the state of the game object.</p>
<h3 id="1-19-A-basic-multiplication-table-example"><a href="#1-19-A-basic-multiplication-table-example" class="headerlink" title="1.19 - A basic multiplication table example"></a>1.19 - <a href="/2020/02/10/js-javascript-example-multiplication-table">A basic multiplication table example</a></h3><p>This was my first post on this collection of javaScript examples, and as such I wanted to start out with something very basic. SO working out a javaScript example that is just a simple multiplication table sure doe stink me as one of those simple hello world type projects that help out for people that are very new to javaScript. However even when it comes to this kind of example there is still a lot to cover, even with something like this. There is not just making a multiplication table and moving on, there is making a function that will create a state object of a multiplication table, and then making at least one if not more renderer’s that will render the state of this multiplication table.</p>
<h3 id="1-20-Nodejs-and-Browser-code-share-module-pattern"><a href="#1-20-Nodejs-and-Browser-code-share-module-pattern" class="headerlink" title="1.20 - Nodejs and Browser code share module pattern"></a>1.20 - <a href="/2021/04/14/js-javascript-example-nodejs-browser-share-code-module/">Nodejs and Browser code share module pattern</a></h3><p>One great thing about nodejs is that I am using the same programing language that is used in web pages to create scripts that will run in an operating system environment. So with that said it should be possible to design some of my modules in a way so that they will work in a nodejs and browser environment without me having to hack over the code a little first.</p>
<h3 id="1-21-An-Orb-Module-example-about-ratios"><a href="#1-21-An-Orb-Module-example-about-ratios" class="headerlink" title="1.21 - An Orb Module example about ratios"></a>1.21 - <a href="/2021/04/09/js-javascript-example-orb-module/">An Orb Module example about ratios</a></h3><p>This is a module where I am working out some basic core logic for something that I might use in a future game or two. It is a module that makes use of ratios as a way to set what kind of object it is. This idea then is to use ratios and point values as a way to set other object properties. These orb objects can then be used in a few different ideas I have for games, many of which are tower defense type games, and other kinds of strategy games.</p>
<h3 id="1-22-A-percent-module-experiment"><a href="#1-22-A-percent-module-experiment" class="headerlink" title="1.22 - A percent module experiment"></a>1.22 - <a href="/2020/11/25/js-javascript-example-percent-module/">A percent module experiment</a></h3><p>So there is having a simple expression like 3 \/ 4 that will result in a value between 0 and 1 that will be \0.25. In other words there is having a numerator and denominator value and getting a fraction between the two. However if a numerator value starts at 0 and approaches the denominator value as a fixed static rate, then the change happens along a straight line when graphed.</p>
<h3 id="1-23-Player-unit-grid"><a href="#1-23-Player-unit-grid" class="headerlink" title="1.23 - Player unit grid"></a>1.23 - <a href="/2021/04/08/js-javascript-example-player-unit-grid/">Player unit grid</a></h3><p>This is a javaScript example where I was experimenting with a simple grid in the center of a canvas that a player can built player units for a game This is one of sever javaScript examples where I am working out some basic logic in an independent project that I might in turn add to a game that I am making.</p>
<h3 id="1-24-Object-pool-library-normalized"><a href="#1-24-Object-pool-library-normalized" class="headerlink" title="1.24 - Object pool library normalized"></a>1.24 - <a href="/2022/01/24/js-javascript-example-pool-normalized/">Object pool library normalized</a></h3><p>This is a new object pool library at least when compared to the project to which this is based on that I stated a while back. It is yet another object pool library, but this time I address a core problem that I ran into with the older one, making this one centered around the idea that it is a point in space that I am moving around first and foremost.</p>
<h3 id="1-25-Ratio-module"><a href="#1-25-Ratio-module" class="headerlink" title="1.25 - Ratio module"></a>1.25 - <a href="/2021/04/13/js-javascript-example-ratio-module">Ratio module</a></h3><p>This is a module that I made as a foundation for my orb module, which in turn might sever to be another modules that I will be using in at least one if not more canvas games. As the name suggests it has to do with ratios, and there is a great deal that comes up when working with them. For example say I have a set of numbers like 5,20,0,15 and I want a function that will return 1,4,0,3 when I pass the previous set of numbers to it. This module provides such a method that helps with this, and there are a whole bunch of other methods like that as well.</p>
<h3 id="1-26-Rotate-and-fire-example"><a href="#1-26-Rotate-and-fire-example" class="headerlink" title="1.26 - Rotate and fire example"></a>1.26 - <a href="/2021/04/05/js-javascript-example-rotate-and-fire/">Rotate and fire example</a></h3><p>This is an example where I worked out some basic logic for a turret defense game when it comes to how the turrets will behave when it comes to rotation and fire control. For example I could make it so that when a player clicks an area of a canvas a turret is just set to an angle that points to that location and then it fires a shot for every click of the canvas. However another way to program this kind of game is to have a rotation rate, as well as a fire rate, and for the turret to only fire once it gets within a certain angular range of the target location that was clicked.</p>
<h3 id="1-27-Skill-Point-System"><a href="#1-27-Skill-Point-System" class="headerlink" title="1.27 - Skill Point System"></a>1.27 - <a href="/2020/08/26/js-javascript-example-skill-point-system/">Skill Point System</a></h3><p>This is a skill point system that I put together to make use of in some canvas examples that might call for such a system. The general idea here is that in a game where there is an experience point system on each level some skill points will be given to the player. These skill points can then be invested into upgrades that have various effects on a main game state object.</p>
<h3 id="1-28-Sort-planets"><a href="#1-28-Sort-planets" class="headerlink" title="1.28 - Sort planets"></a>1.28 - <a href="/2020/08/31/js-javascript-example-sort-planets/">Sort planets</a></h3><p>A simple sort of planets objects example that I might use if a future game if I ever get around to it. The idea of this example is that I just wanted to make a simple fun little example that makes use of the array sort method to which I wrote a quick blog post on. I wanted to go at least one step beyond just having a simple copy and paste hello world style example of array sort, and with that goal in mind I guess this example is more or less just that. I am not sure if I will every get around to expanding on this by making a real game based off of it, but in any case I all ready have an interesting starting point for something here to say the least.</p>
<h3 id="1-29-Tax-brackets"><a href="#1-29-Tax-brackets" class="headerlink" title="1.29 - Tax brackets"></a>1.29 - <a href="/2020/02/27/js-javascript-example-tax-brackets/">Tax brackets</a></h3><p>A tax brackets example that helps me to get a general idea of how a progressive tax system works when it comes to things like income tax. I would not use this as a way to do ones own taxes of course, but it is a module that I might use in one form or another in some kind of game where I might want a module such as this.</p>
<h3 id="1-30-Test-Module"><a href="#1-30-Test-Module" class="headerlink" title="1.30 - Test Module"></a>1.30 - <a href="/2021/04/12/js-javascript-example-test-module/">Test Module</a></h3><p>This is a test module that can be used to run a collection of tests on a method to make sure that the results that the method returns are expected results when given a certain set of arguments. There are many popular frameworks out in the open web that have to do with this sort of thing. Many of those might prove to be a better solution than what I have slapped together here, but still I think that this is an important part of the process of creating, and certainly maintaining a real javaScript project.</p>
<h3 id="1-31-Tool-Source-Layer-Art-Program"><a href="#1-31-Tool-Source-Layer-Art-Program" class="headerlink" title="1.31 - Tool Source Layer Art Program"></a>1.31 - <a href="/2022/01/31/js-javascript-example-tool-source-layer-2d/">Tool Source Layer Art Program</a></h3><p>I started the first of what in time might become a few javaScript examples where the aim is to make a basic software tool of some kind that I might actually use now and then. The idea here with this project is to create a simple art program where I open up some kind of resource image and I can then use that resource image as a resource to draw on top of. In other words is is just a quick way to create a kind of basic art program where I will want to use some kind of resource to look at while drawing.</p>
<h3 id="1-32-Trade-Sim"><a href="#1-32-Trade-Sim" class="headerlink" title="1.32 - Trade Sim"></a>1.32 - <a href="/2021/04/07/js-javascript-example-trade-sim/">Trade Sim</a></h3><p>This is a simple trade simulator module that I might use as a starting point for a more advanced version that could be used in a game. The general idea here is that the player has a way to buy items as a certain rate, and then sell them at another rate later on. Depending if the rate goes up or down they will stand to gain or lose money. I have come across this kind of feature in games here and there in the past and I think it is a nice feature to have in certain types of games, so I made a simple starting point for this kind of feature.</p>
<h3 id="1-33-A-turn-based-RPG-game"><a href="#1-33-A-turn-based-RPG-game" class="headerlink" title="1.33 - A turn based RPG game"></a>1.33 - <a href="/2021/12/10/js-javascript-example-turn-based-rpg/">A turn based RPG game</a></h3><p>The aim with this example is to continue to expand on the source code of my grid unit movement javaScript example in which I worked out the basics for a simple turn based RPG style game. The focus here is to add additional features and see about improving the quality of the existing source code too while I am at it. As of this writing a custom state machine for the game has been added, as well as a menu system inspired by the super Nintendo game Secret of Mana. I have a lot more planed for this example, but thus far I think that I should stick to write about what I have all ready done rather than what the next steps are.</p>
<h3 id="1-34-utils-module"><a href="#1-34-utils-module" class="headerlink" title="1.34 - utils module"></a>1.34 - <a href="/2021/08/06/js-javascript-example-utils/">utils module</a></h3><p>This is a javaScript example of a general utility module, that is an example, not the example. The nature of this kind of module will differ from one project to another, but I created an example of a file that has the usual suspects that I have in such a module.</p>
<h3 id="1-35-Zig-Zag-Arc"><a href="#1-35-Zig-Zag-Arc" class="headerlink" title="1.35 - Zig Zag Arc"></a>1.35 - <a href="/2020/08/10/js-javascript-example-zig-zag-arc/">Zig Zag Arc</a></h3><p>Another basic example that makes use of some methods I work out in my percent module example. This is a canvas example that makes use of functions in my percent module that result in zig zag like movement across the canvas. This is then just one of many applications of the percent modules that I had in mind.</p>
<h2 id="2-Conclusion"><a href="#2-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="2 - Conclusion"></a>2 - Conclusion</h2><p>That is it for now when it comes to this collection of javaScript examples, as I come up with more I will be sure to come around to expand this list and link back to this post from the newer posts also which is often what I do for these kinds of collections. </p>
<p>If you want to check out additional posts like this, but with other collections of examples I have a similar post where I am just going over <a href="/2020/03/23/canvas-example/">canvas examples</a> rather than just things that might just have to do with a little javaScript code and that is it. I have a lot of canvas projects in various stages of completion, and some of them might even turn into one or more real games if I ever manage to do so.</p>
