        <p>In <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene" target="_blank" rel="external">threejs</a> there are a few materials to choose from to help skin a mesh object that all share the same <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/materials/Material" target="_blank" rel="external">Material base class</a>. There are also additional materials for rendering lines, points, shadows, and sprites that stand out from the various materials that are used to change the look of solid mesh objects.</p>
<p>There are materials that will respond to a light source, and then there are materials that will not. When it comes to materials that respond to light some will preform a little better than others, but will result in a different look compared to others that are a little more resource heavy. When it comes to mesh materials that will not respond to a light source there are materials like the basic mesh material that is a good choice when it comes to just having a simple color map for the mesh. There are a few other materials that render textures based on the state of the normal property of the geometry used, or based on the depth in terms of a distance from the camera.</p>
<p>This post will serve as a general overview of the mesh materials in general in three.js then as a starting point for learning what the options are with this. I will give a very basic overview of the base Material class, and get into some of the differences between materials used with a Mesh, as well as the other kinds of materials. I will of course not be getting into every key little detail with each of them, some of these will deserve a full post explaining them in further detail, and I will link to those posts from here as I write them.</p>

<h2 id="Materials-in-threejs-and-what-to-know-first"><a href="#Materials-in-threejs-and-what-to-know-first" class="headerlink" title="Materials in threejs and what to know first"></a>Materials in threejs and what to know first</h2><p>This is not my <a href="/2018/04/04/threejs-getting-started/">getting started post on threejs</a>, if you are new to threejs you might choose to start with a post in which the basics of the library are covered. I assume you have basic knowledge of how to make a threejs project, and now only seek to have a deeper understanding of materials to work with when it comes to creating mesh objects. Also even if you have some experience with threejs there is a whole lot of other topics that branch off from the use of materials of course. So in this section I will be writing about a few things that you might want to read up more on regardless of experience.</p>
<h3 id="The-color-class-and-the-color-and-emissive-options-of-materials"><a href="#The-color-class-and-the-color-and-emissive-options-of-materials" class="headerlink" title="The color class, and the color and emissive options of materials"></a>The color class, and the color and emissive options of materials</h3><p>The <a href="/2021/05/03/threejs-color">Color class</a> can prove to be useful for creating color values for the various material options that expect a color for the value. Also it is a helpful tool for working with color in general. For example it can be used in the process of creating a color from some expressions that compute values for each color channel and then the get style method can be used to get a string values that can be used to set the fill or stroke style when drawing to a canvas element</p>
<p>Speaking of color many materials have a way to set a color option for the material, but how this works will change a little from one material to another. For example the basic material will not do anything with light, so when a solid color is set for the basic material that will just be the solid color for all the faces of the geometry used in the mesh. So then one might assume that will be the case in all other materials, but that is not true. The color property in the standard material is more or less the same thing, but it works in conjunction with what is going on when it comes to light in a scene. So if I set a solid color for an instance of a standard material, but do not add light to a scene, then I will not see anything. So when it comes to the standard material there is another property that comes into play called the emissive property. It is this emissive property that I use to set a color that will always show up not matter what when it comes to what might be going on with light.</p>
<h3 id="Lots-of-overlap-with-Materials-and-Geometry"><a href="#Lots-of-overlap-with-Materials-and-Geometry" class="headerlink" title="Lots of overlap with Materials and Geometry"></a>Lots of overlap with Materials and Geometry</h3><p>There is a lot of overlap between materials and geometry of course so you might want to read more on the <a href="/2021/04/22/threejs-buffer-geometry/">subject of geometry in general</a> then. For example certain features of materials will not work at all of corresponding attributes of the geometry are not there such as the Vertex Colors options of the material begin set to true not working because there is no color attribute in the geometry. Speaking of buffer geometry attributes it might not be such a bad idea to look into what the position, normal, and <a href="/2021/06/09/threejs-buffer-geometry-attributes-uv/">uv</a> attributes of a geometry are if you have not done so at this time.</p>
<h3 id="Source-is-also-on-Github"><a href="#Source-is-also-on-Github" class="headerlink" title="Source is also on Github"></a>Source is also on Github</h3><p>The source for these examples is <a href="https://github.com/dustinpfister/test_threejs/tree/master/views/forpost/threejs-materials" target="_blank" rel="external">also on Github</a> in my test threejs repo. This is also where I place all the source code that I work out for my many <a href="/categories/three-js/">other blog posts on various threejs topics</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Version-number-matters-with-three-js"><a href="#Version-number-matters-with-three-js" class="headerlink" title="Version number matters with three.js"></a>Version number matters with three.js</h3><p>Threejs is a project in which the version number matters a whole lot as older posts on threejs often contain examples that will break on newer revisions and vise versa. When I first started writing this post I was using <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/r91" target="_blank" rel="external">three.js 0.91.0 (r91)</a>. However the last time I came around to edit this post I updated all of the demos to what I have layed down for my <a href="https://github.com/dustinpfister/test_threejs/blob/master/views/demos/r146/README.md" target="_blank" rel="external">r146 style rules</a>. This means that for the demos in this post I am still using plain javaScript script tags over that of modules type script tags. However this will be the last revision in which I will be doing that. There are a whole lot of code breaking changes up ahead that I will not be getting into detail about here. However I will say that it is as always very important to know what revision you are using, and also what revision an author of content might have used when writing a post such as this.</p>
<h2 id="1-Basic-getting-started-type-exmaples-of-matreials"><a href="#1-Basic-getting-started-type-exmaples-of-matreials" class="headerlink" title="1 - Basic getting started type exmaples of matreials"></a>1 - Basic getting started type exmaples of matreials</h2><p>There is a whole lot to say about materials in general, so this is going to be a very lengthy post. However there is just going over a few very basic examples of materials that should help to address most general concerns when first getting started with threejs. The main focus in this post then will just be one the fact that there is more than one kind of material for more than one kind of object. That is that there are mesh objects, and other options like lines, and that any one material will have its own options, as well a common options that are shared across all materials.</p>
<h3 id="1-1-First-Things-First-A-Basic-Mesh-example"><a href="#1-1-First-Things-First-A-Basic-Mesh-example" class="headerlink" title="1.1 - First Things First, A Basic Mesh example"></a>1.1 - First Things First, A Basic Mesh example</h3><p>One of the best ways to get started is to just create a box geometry to create a mesh object. When it comes to a mesh material options that will help show some depth without a light source a good one for that would be the mesh normal material. I will be going over what all the mesh material options are in a section later in this post, but for now there is just getting that very first simple demo up and working.</p>
<p>So after setting up the usual collection of objects when it comes to things like the main scene object, camera, and renderer I then create an instance of the mesh normal material. When doing so I am not going to bother with any options at all. There are of course options for the mesh normal material, as well as base material class options as well as a whole lot about geometry as well. However much of that will have to come up in the more advanced sections of this post.</p>

<h3 id="1-2-More-than-one-kind-of-object-so-more-than-one-kind-of-material"><a href="#1-2-More-than-one-kind-of-object-so-more-than-one-kind-of-material" class="headerlink" title="1.2 - More than one kind of object, so more than one kind of material"></a>1.2 - More than one kind of object, so more than one kind of material</h3><p>Most of the time I do very much use mesh objects, but there are also line and point objects as well that can be used as a way to display some content. For this example then I am creating a mesh and using the basic material for the mesh. This will often result in just a solid mass of color in the canvas when just used with the color option and nothing else. There is of course using a texture as a way to show some depth with this kind of material, but another way would be to add points, lines or both in this case as child objects of the mesh.</p>
<p>When it comes to using a line I must use the LineBasicMaterial or the LineBasicMaterial. When it comes to points there is just the point material alone that can be used to add style to these kinds of objects. There are some options that are just for each kind of material alone. For example the size option is just for points, and the lineWidth options is just for lines. However there are common options as well such as color in this example.</p>

<h3 id="1-3-Just-getting-started-with-texture-and-materials"><a href="#1-3-Just-getting-started-with-texture-and-materials" class="headerlink" title="1.3 - Just getting started with texture and materials"></a>1.3 - Just getting started with texture and materials</h3><p>One of the first things that many will want to figure out right away is how to go about getting started with textures and how to apply these textures to objects. Of course there is a great deal to cover when it comes to this, and not just with respect to the lengthy volume of options for materials that will take a texture as the value. There is a great deal of overlap with geometry as well when it comes to advanced topics surrounding the uv attribute of geometry and so forth. Still one has to start somewhere when it comes to textures and materials, so lets start out with a basic example of that then.</p>
<p>Although there is a lot to say about the geometry on top of the material option used, for this demo the focus is just going to be on how to get a texture to begin with. There is of course loading one or more images and then using those images as a way to create texture object. However there is also the subject of how to go about creating textures by way of some javaScript code. With that said the best way to go about doing that might very well be by way of canvas textures. This is a way to go about creating a texture object by passing a canvas element, and when it comes to creating the content of that canvas one can use everything there is to work with when it comes to the 2d drawing context, or any context for that matter.</p>

<h3 id="1-4-Arrays-of-materials"><a href="#1-4-Arrays-of-materials" class="headerlink" title="1.4 - Arrays of materials"></a>1.4 - Arrays of materials</h3><p>One of the many subjects that I see being overlooked in other blog posts on materials in general in threejs is the subject of using an array of materials. This subject alone can quickly turn into a time consuming black hole if one lets it become that and I have many times off an on over the years. There is a lot of overlap with this subject as there is not just simply passing an array of materials but also adding or chaining the state of the groups property of the geometry. For the sake of this basic section demo though there is just using the box geometry constructor as this has a groups property set up to begin with. Also on top of that the groups are set up to make use of six materials one for each side of the box which would often be the case when doing this sort of thing. So to get started with this as least one will just need to pass an array of six materials rather than just one when making the mesh object that will use the box geometry.</p>

<p>Do not let this fool you though if you thing that this is how to add texture to 3d objects. The first and foremost way to do this would typically be to use just one material, with one texture, and a well worked out uv attributive for the geometry. However some times there are in fact situations in which it would be a good idea to use more than one material for a mesh, and this is how to get started with it. Once again the groups are set up to begin with in this demo though, so when it comes to working on an asset of some kind one might need to work out the state of the groups array.</p>
<h3 id="1-5-UV-mapping-and-textures"><a href="#1-5-UV-mapping-and-textures" class="headerlink" title="1.5 - UV mapping and textures"></a>1.5 - UV mapping and textures</h3><p>Although an array of materials can be used as a way to skin each side of a Box Geometry, this is not the way to go about skinning a geometry in general. The first and foremost way to skin a Box Geometry, or any geometry for that matter is to create, or in this case mutate the values of the <a href="/2021/06/09/threejs-buffer-geometry-attributes-uv/">uv attribute</a>. This attribute of a geometry contains offset values for each point in the <a href="/2021/06/07/threejs-buffer-geometry-attributes-position/">position attribute</a> of the geometry which is the actual points in space.</p>
<p>Anyway when it comes to a box geometry the UV attribute is set up for us to begin with. However by default the values are set in such a way that all of the content of the texture will be used for all of the faces of the box. Often this might very well be what I would want to happen when creating this kind of geometry anyway. However in some cases I might want to map just one area of a texture to one face, and then another area to another face and so forth. To do that I will need to write a little logic to set the values of the uv attributes to what I want for that kind of situation which is what I am doing in this demo.</p>

<p>So what is going on with this demo on basic UV mapping and materials is that once again I am just passing a texture for the map option of an instance of the Basic Material. However this time when it comes to the nature of the texture I have worked out a little logic where I am drawing a whole bunch of cells in the texture. I will then want to have a way to draw a given cell in the texture to a given face index, and that is what I am doing with the additional logic that has to do with the mutation of the UV attribute values.</p>
<p>There is a whole lot more to write about this sort of subject of course that I will have to get into more later in this post in the texture section. However I wanted to work out at least one basic section demo of this along with the material array index values demo just to make it clear right away that an array of materials and the groups array is just one tool that is not a replacement for UV mapping.</p>
<h3 id="1-6-A-Basic-Starting-example-of-light-and-a-material-that-will-work-with-light"><a href="#1-6-A-Basic-Starting-example-of-light-and-a-material-that-will-work-with-light" class="headerlink" title="1.6 - A Basic Starting example of light and a material that will work with light"></a>1.6 - A Basic Starting example of light and a material that will work with light</h3><p>There is a whole lot of get into when it comes to the subject of adding light to a scene, and using materials that will work with one or more light sources. With that said I do very much have an advanced section in this post in which I get into this subject in depth. However this is still very much the basic section  of the post so if you just simply want to get started with light the demo I have here should be just that.</p>
<p>First off not all mesh material options will even work with a light source to begin with. So if you are using say the MeshBasicMaterial and wondering why it is that the light source you added is not working that is why. I have a section in this post in which I go over the various options for mesh materials, including the ones that will work with light, but for now I am just going to go with the Phong Material.</p>
<p>When working with a material that will respond to light sources the color option of the material will be the color that will show up to one extent or another depending on what the situation is with lighting. If you are wondering if there is another kind of material option that will define a color that will always show up regardless of what is going on with light the typical option for that in most mesh material options is the emissive color option. Be default this is set to black, so you might want to set it to something other than black if you want to use this color option. There is then also adjusting that by way of the emissive Intesnity option. The Phong material has a few other options that are relevant to the use of light such as the specular color and the shininess options.</p>
<p>There is then the question of what kind of light source to add. I will not be getting into depth here with that of course, so for now I think a good starting option for that might be directional light.</p>

<p>So this might be a good starting point for light but there is still a whole lot more to read about when it comes to the various material options that a relevant to the use of light. There are a number of various texture map options for example, and also various little details from one mesh object to the next. If you want to read more on this there is the advanced light section later in this post in which I will be expanding more on this topic.</p>
<h3 id="1-7-Getting-started-with-textures-and-Materials"><a href="#1-7-Getting-started-with-textures-and-Materials" class="headerlink" title="1.7 - Getting started with textures and Materials"></a>1.7 - Getting started with textures and Materials</h3><p>If you just simply want to get started with textures and materials without having to read about every little fine grain detail to be aware of with this sort of thing that will be what this demo is all about here. There are a whole lot of ways to get started with texture, but I think one of the best ways would be to use the plain old 2d drawing context of canvas elements and then pass the canvas element to the THREE.CanvasTexture constructor as a quick way to create some texture with javaScript code rather than an external image. Once one has a texture a good starting material option might be the map option of the basic material.</p>

<p>Although a demo like this might be a good start there is a whole lot more to be aware of when it comes to textures, features of geometry objects such as the UV attribute, and of course a massive amount of things to be aware of when it comes to material options and textures. What there is to work with in terms of material options will change form one material to the next. Also the way that options work will change form material to material as well including this map option as it will not work the same way as with the Basic Material in other mesh material options such as the Phong material. Be sore to read on with my Mesh Materials section and the textures section in this post for more details with this.</p>
<h2 id="2-Overview-of-Mesh-Material-Options"><a href="#2-Overview-of-Mesh-Material-Options" class="headerlink" title="2 - Overview of Mesh Material Options"></a>2 - Overview of Mesh Material Options</h2><p>There might be points and lines, but for the most part just about every threejs project will make use of Mesh objects, or a similar kind of objects that will also make use of one of the Mesh Material Options. There is a whole lot to be aware of with these so it is called for to run over each of them and at least write a thing or two about that each material is good for and why.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that if you feel that you are getting overwhelmed with all of this the most important thing is application. If you want to go with a certain style the involves low poly models, a simple color map, and not bother at all with light in any capacity then just going with the MeshBasicMaterial might prove to work okay. Things just get a little complex when you start pulling light into the mix, or you need to do some kind of weird custom rendering to which even none of these might work okay and as such you might need to go with the shader material and some custom GLSL code. However getting into that is a whole other matter for now.. </p>
<h3 id="2-1-Mesh-Basic-Material"><a href="#2-1-Mesh-Basic-Material" class="headerlink" title="2.1 - Mesh Basic Material"></a>2.1 - Mesh Basic Material</h3><p>The <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/materials/MeshBasicMaterial" target="_blank" rel="external">basic material</a> is the kind of material that I would use if I do not aim to do anything special with light. The basic material will not respond to any light sources, and the faces will be filled with a solid color if it is just the color option alone that will be used with it. However there are a lot of options whe it comes to doing things to show some depth, one option would be to create a texture by one means or another and use that with the map option. Another option would be to add a color attribute to the geometry that is used, and then set the vertex color boolean of the material to true. Do not let the name fool you with this one, the Basic material is not so basic, you still have everything that there is to work with in the common base material class, as well as a lot of features with the Basic material itself.</p>
<p>Yet another option for seeing some depth would be involve adding a child object of some kind such as lines that use a geometry that is created by passing the geometry of the parent object into the edge geometry constructor. If using textures to show depth there is then doing some shading when drawing the textures themselves that are to be used with the geometry that is worked out. With this said this is often the typical use case when it comes to using this material in an actual project.</p>

<p>There are a number of ways of going about using the map option all of which will involve getting a texture object one way or another, such as using the <a href="/2021/06/21/threejs-texture-loader/">texture loader</a> to load in a texture from an external image, but there are also a number of ways of doing so that will involve the use of some javaScript code to create a texture. Once option would be to use <a href="/2018/04/17/threejs-canvas-texture/">canvas elements</a>, and another would be to make use of the <a href="/2022/04/15/threejs-data-texture/">data texture constructor</a> as a way to create a texture from raw color channel data as I went with in this demo.</p>

<p>Depth is based off the near, and far plane of the camera when can be set when creating the camera, and can also be changed in a loop by calling a special update method. White areas indicate that an area of the mesh is closer to the camera, while darker areas indicate that the area of the mesh is farther away.</p>
<p>There does not appear to be much to write about in terms of other properties to know about with this one aside from the fact that the depth packing encoding can be changed from the default which is basic depth packing. The only other constant seems to be rgba packing.</p>

<p>To get this material working great It might be best to use some kind of directional light source such as a spotlight. The specular property can be used to set the color of the shine, by default it is a very dark gray.</p>
<h3 id="2-6-Mesh-Standard-Material"><a href="#2-6-Mesh-Standard-Material" class="headerlink" title="2.6 - Mesh Standard Material"></a>2.6 - Mesh Standard Material</h3><p>The <a href="/2021/04/27/threejs-standard-material/">standard material</a> might be the best option for most surfaces if a more realistic rather than speedy rendering is desired when it comes to doing something with light. The standard material will also work with a wide range of various texture maps, and is somewhat of an industry standard, thus the name standard material. I tend to like to go with this material as it is generally a great all around material that results in a decent look when it comes to working on a final result.</p>
<p>Because this material supports light it is called for to use this material with a light source in order for anything to be seen when it comes to the color and map attributes of the material. If a light source is not going to be used it is still possible to have something to see with this material it is just that values need to be set with the emissive and emissive map properties rather than color and map alone witch is the case with the basic material.</p>
<p>Unlike the phong material this material does not support specular highlights, but it would appear that is the only feature lost of interest compared to phong.</p>

<h2 id="3-The-Points-Material"><a href="#3-The-Points-Material" class="headerlink" title="3 - The Points Material"></a>3 - The Points Material</h2><p>There is one Material in threejs that can be used to display just the points in a geometry which can come in handy some times. One major use case with this has to do with creating custom geometry from the ground up as this helps to keep things simple as I only need to worry about the position attribute of the geometry.</p>
<h3 id="3-1-The-Points-Material"><a href="#3-1-The-Points-Material" class="headerlink" title="3.1 - The Points Material"></a>3.1 - The Points Material</h3><p>If for some reason I want to create my own custom geometry in which I only care about points in space and nothing at all then I will want to have at least a <a href="/2021/06/07/threejs-buffer-geometry-attributes-position/">position attribute of the buffer geometry instance</a> that I will the use with the THREE.Points constructor rather than the usual mesh constructor. So for this example I am creating a blank buffer geometry object and then I will want to create a typed array that will contain the values for each axis of each point. For now I will be keeping this simple by just adding points for a single triangle in space. However when it comes to using points if I want I could make this even more basic by just setting a single point for the typed array. Anyway once I have my data worked out for this I can call the Buffer Attribute constructor and pass the array as the first argument and then the item size which in the case is 3 as there is x, y, and z for each point. This buffer attribute object can then be used when calling the set attribute method of the blank buffer geometry object to create the position attribute of the geometry.</p>
<p>When it comes to creating an instance of the Points material I will just be creating a single instance of this material, and just set a color option for it. </p>

<h2 id="4-Lines-Material"><a href="#4-Lines-Material" class="headerlink" title="4 - Lines Material"></a>4 - Lines Material</h2><p>Another object to work with that is an alternative to a mesh object would be <a href="/2018/04/19/threejs-line/">THREE.Line</a> or THREE.LineSegments. There are two material options to choose from when it comes to using these kinds of objects which include THREE.LineBasicMaterial and THREE.LineDashedMaterial. They work just like mesh objects in the sense that the first argument that is passed when making one is a geometry. Just like that of THREE.Points though it is just the position attribute of the geometry of these that matter. This is a good reason why as this the use of these kinds of objects help to simplify the process of creating custom geometry. However it is also one of the best reasons why not to use them as well. If you care about how the final product looks you might want to look into <a href="/2023/06/02/threejs-tube-geometry/">curves and the tube geometry</a> class as an tentative to the use of these kinds of objects and materials.</p>

These sprite objects are a way to add a texture to a scene that will always face the camera. I can then also adjust the scale and position values of the sprite objects to move them around in the scene and adjust the size. However there are also a number of options for the material, and also some relevant base material class features to write about with these.</p>

Like with the Points material there is also a size attenuation option that I will want to set to false for this kind of application. After that I can use the object2d features of the sprite object to do things like adjust the scale, and the position of the sprite in the scene.</p>

<h2 id="6-The-Common-Base-Material-class"><a href="#6-The-Common-Base-Material-class" class="headerlink" title="6 - The Common Base Material class"></a>6 - The Common Base Material class</h2><p>There are a number of options in the base material class that should work with all materials, but there are some exceptions with some of these features. For example the side option is very much a part of the base material class, but this option has no effect when used with line or point materials. Still there are lots of options in the base material class that do work with more or less all materials and in this section I will be going over a few key examples of these base material class features.</p>
<h3 id="6-1-Transparent-and-opacity-options"><a href="#6-1-Transparent-and-opacity-options" class="headerlink" title="6.1 - Transparent and opacity options"></a>6.1 - Transparent and opacity options</h3><p>The transparent boolen can be used to set transparency on and off for a material. In the event that transparency is on the opacity value can be used to set the global alpha value of the transparency for the material. This feature seems to work okay for just about all mesh materials, and also for points and lines as well.</p>

In any case for the sake of this one demo in this over all base material class section it goes without saying that I should have at least one demo on this subject here to touch base on this at least. </p>
<p>For now I worked out this demo where I am setting the blending value of all materials used to the THREE.NoBlending constant over that of what the default is for materials which is THREE.NormalBlending.</p>

<h3 id="6-3-Vertex-colors"><a href="#6-3-Vertex-colors" class="headerlink" title="6.3 - Vertex colors"></a>6.3 - Vertex colors</h3><p>One major base material class feature would be the vertex colors Boolean that when set to true will cause the material to use the color attribute of the geometry if it has one. Although this is a base material class feature it will not work with all materials, some will not make use of the base class feature such as the MeshNormalMaterial. However it does work with most mesh material options such as basic, standard, and phong just to name a s few. This feature also works with line materials and the points materials as well as a great way to style those materials when they are used.</p>
<p>If the geometry does not have a color attribute then one will need to be created for the geometry. If you would like to read more about his topic you might want to check out my <a href="/2023/01/20/threejs-buffer-geometry-attributes-color/">main blog post on color attributes</a> in buffer geometry objects.</p>

Often I might want to set this to THREE.DoubleSide, and in a few rare cases THREE.BackSide. If you are wondering how the side of a face is determined it has to do with the order of the points in the position attribute of the geometry, or the index of it.</p>

One way of doing this would be to work out some kind of system for layering, that is to have more than one renderer and therefor canvas element, and then just set the render order of all of these canvas elements in such a way that what I need rendering on top will be drawn to a final canvas element last. Doing something such as that will work of course, but one way to get a desired outcome with a single canvas and  renderer might be to set the depth test option of the material of the object that i want to render on top to false.</p>

<h2 id="7-Blending-options"><a href="#7-Blending-options" class="headerlink" title="7 - Blending options"></a>7 - Blending options</h2><p>I covered one demo of the blending option in the above section in which I go over many of the features of the main material class. However I would say that the blending option does very much deserve a section of its own.</p>
<h3 id="7-1-No-Blending-compared-to-default-normal-blending"><a href="#7-1-No-Blending-compared-to-default-normal-blending" class="headerlink" title="7.1 - No Blending compared to default normal blending"></a>7.1 - No Blending compared to default normal blending</h3><p>I have all ready covered one demo of the no blending value for the blending option. However there are some things that I should do different in this section of blending in depth. To start oput this section I am once again going to go with a demo that makes use of the no blending option over that of the default blending mode which is normal blending. However this time I am going to have two objects with two materials to have something to compare to. </p>
<p>Also I am doing something out of the usual when it comes to rendering in this example and will also be doing so for the rest of these demos. The thing that I am doing different here is that I am using a canvas element that I draw to with the plain old 2d drawing content as the element that I am appending to my hard coded HTML. I am then drawing to this plain old 2d canvas with the drawImage method of the 2d canvas and I am passing the canvas of the webgl renderer as the image to draw with. This then allows me to use the 2d drawing context to draw a background that will show up when the canvas of the webgl renderer is transparent.</p>

<h2 id="8-The-Material-loader-and-other-loader-related-concerns"><a href="#8-The-Material-loader-and-other-loader-related-concerns" class="headerlink" title="8 - The Material loader, and other loader related concerns"></a>8 - The Material loader, and other loader related concerns</h2><p>Creating a material by calling one of the constructor functions as a way to obtain a material is one thing. However when it comes to starting to work on real projects I will want to have a way to pack a lot of the data that has to do with one or more materials into some kind of external file format. With that said baked into the core of threejs itself is the <a href="/2023/07/27/threejs-materials-loader/">Material Loader</a> which is one option for doing this sort of thing. </p>
<p>However there are also a lot of other options for loading not just a material but other data that is needed to create final display objects. There is then a lot to say about how to go about loading materials, as well as everything else that one would want to load into a project by way of some external data as well such as textures to use with such materials. So in this section I will be writing a thing or two about loaders and what the options are for at least materials, but maybe also a few that help with more than just that.</p>
<h3 id="8-1-Parse-a-JSON-string-of-a-material-using-THREE-MaterialLoader"><a href="#8-1-Parse-a-JSON-string-of-a-material-using-THREE-MaterialLoader" class="headerlink" title="8.1 - Parse a JSON string of a material using THREE.MaterialLoader"></a>8.1 - Parse a JSON string of a material using THREE.MaterialLoader</h3><p>The toJSON method of a material can be used to convert a material to a JSON object format, that Object can then be passed to JSON.stringify to create a JSON text form that can then be used with the THREE.MaterialLoader. However for this demo I am hand coding a string of json and I would like to parse it into a workable material that I can then use with a mesh object. To create a material from one of these strings I can pass the string threw the JSON.parse method to get an object to which I can then pass to the parse method of an instance of the material loader. The end result of the call of the parse method is then  a material that I can then use with a mesh object just like with any other.</p>
<p>So then it would look like the JSON string of this demo could then be saved as a json file, and this JSON file can then also be loaded with the material loader as well.</p>

However I have found that what often makes things a little tricky is the question of how to go about loading external image files that I want to use with the various material options that need a texture object. Also the material loader is just simply that, so with that said what about geometry, objects, animations and so on. So then I am of the mindset that <a href="/2023/07/19/threejs-object-loader/">the object loader</a> is a good option for having some kind of plain text format to work with that can then be loader with a loader option that is baked into the core of the threejs library alone.</p>

It is possible to get textures working with the material loader, but as one would expect it involves loading the images, and then creating a special object where each key of the textures object is the value to set for each material option key that is to use the texture in the JSON data. This way I can just bake everything that has to do with a single object, into just one file. Not just the material, and the material option values, but also all the additional values of the texture objects, and with that the image data used for each texture object.</p>
<p>Again with the material loader if I use the texture loader that will just create a new texture with the image that UI load. If for example I need to load a texture with all kinds of custom values for the image I can not do that with the texture loader. I am sure that there are ways of dealing with these issues and also there are things about going that way that will help to keep me from repeating data, but still over all this just makes things a lot easier.</p>
<p>For example everything that I want for a single object can be baked into a json file like this:</p>

<h2 id="9-Textures"><a href="#9-Textures" class="headerlink" title="9 - Textures"></a>9 - Textures</h2><p>In the basic section I covered a simple getting started type example of the use of textures and materials. However there is of course a whole lot more to write about <a href="/2023/06/27/threejs-texture">when it comes to textures</a>, and how they overlap with geometry, and yes mesh material options that require a texture as the value to be given. In the basic example I was using the map option for the texture which is a good start but there are of course many other options from one material to another. So in this section the focus is going to be more so on textures, but while I am at it I will of course need to focus on features of buffer geometry objects as well, mainly the <a href="/2021/06/09/threejs-buffer-geometry-attributes-uv/">uv attribute</a> which I would say that you would want to look into more at some point.</p>
<p> I will also have to at least touch base on many other various features of threejs that are relevant to the use of textures with materials such as light sources. However this is still very much a section on the subject of materials in general with threejs. So there will still be a lot to say about the various options when it comes to the kinds of maps there are to work with from one material to another.</p>
<h3 id="9-1-Repeating-The-WrapS-and-WrapT-properties-of-textures"><a href="#9-1-Repeating-The-WrapS-and-WrapT-properties-of-textures" class="headerlink" title="9.1 - Repeating The WrapS and WrapT properties of textures"></a>9.1 - Repeating The WrapS and WrapT properties of textures</h3><p>One thing that might come up when dealing with a texture, geometry, and the material that is being used with a mesh is a situation that will happen when dealing with uv attributes values that will go out of range of the texture. I have found that it is a good practice to try to keep the uv attributes values in a range between 0, and 1. However that is more of a guild line than a rule it would seem on my part as I see a lot of uv generator code that does very much result in UV values that go out of that range. This might not present much of a problem though as long as you know about what the deal is with the wrapS and wrapT values of the texture object mind you.</p>
<p>By default the wrapS and wrapT properties of a texture will be set to the THREE.ClampToEdgeWrapping, which again should not be a problem as along as you keep the UV values in the 0 to 1 range. However if UV values are going are of range, and you can not work out how to go about addressing that, then you might try setting the wrapS and wrapT property values to THREE.RepeatWrapping. The demo in this section will do a good job of showing what the deal is with this.</p>

<h3 id="9-2-Light-standard-material-Set-UVmapping-of-BoxGeometry-diffuse-and-emissive-maps"><a href="#9-2-Light-standard-material-Set-UVmapping-of-BoxGeometry-diffuse-and-emissive-maps" class="headerlink" title="9.2 - Light, standard material, Set UVmapping of BoxGeometry, diffuse and emissive maps"></a>9.2 - Light, standard material, Set UVmapping of BoxGeometry, diffuse and emissive maps</h3><p>This example features a helper function that can be called over and over again to create not one, but many textures using canvas elements. I am then using this create canvas texture helper to create not one but two textures. One texture will be used for the map option of an instance of the standard material, and the other texture will be used for the emissive map of the material. </p>
<p>As I have covered in the mesh materials section the standard material is an example of the kind of material that will respond to a light source. As such the map option does not work the same way as it does in say the basic material as the texture will only show up when some light is shining on it. There is however the emissive color, and with that the emissive map that will work like what one might be used to when it comes to the use of the basic material. So for the instance of the standard material in this demo I am using one texture for the map option, and another for the emissive map option. I am also using the emissive option to set what the emissive color is as I will want it to be something other than the default black color, and there is also the emissive intensity option that will of course adjust the intestacy of the emissive effect.</p>

<h3 id="9-3-Rotation-of-UV-values-demo"><a href="#9-3-Rotation-of-UV-values-demo" class="headerlink" title="9.3 - Rotation of UV values demo"></a>9.3 - Rotation of UV values demo</h3><p>For this demo I worked out another demo that has to do with the mutation of the uv attribute to change what the state is when it comes to mapping the 2d texture to the 3D geometry. With this demo I am once again just using the Mesh Basic Material with the map option and I am once again using a canvas texture to create a simple texture with a little javaScript code. This time I am also once again mutating the state of the uv attribute but now I am doing so in a way that will result in a rotation kind of effect with a very simple plain geometry once again.</p>
<p>This demo might be a bit off topic when it comes to materials, but still a major part of starting to do something involving a final product of some kind will have to deal with setting up things with the UV attribute. The focus here in this section is still with materials, but there is not just what is going on with materials but also the state of the geometry as well.</p>

<h2 id="10-Light-and-Materials"><a href="#10-Light-and-Materials" class="headerlink" title="10 - Light and Materials"></a>10 - Light and Materials</h2><p>Of course I am going to need to write at least a few things about light sources and materials in general in threejs. The first thing that people that are new to threejs should know is that not all materials will work with light sources to begin with. Another major thing is that some of the options of materials will work a little differently between certain materials. I would say that this is the case with the color option of the basic material compared to that of a material that will work with light such as the standard material. So in this section I will be focusing on at least some of these basic details about light. You might want to check out my <a href="/2022/02/25/threejs-light/">main blog post on light in threejs</a> if you would like to read up more on this subject though.</p>

This is a kind of object where I just set the direction part of the Vector of the position property of the directional light object to create a situation in which light is moving in an even, parallel direction along the direction part alone of the position. Sense it is just the direction part of the vector that matters with this light option I might choose to <a href="/2021/06/14/threejs-vector3-normalize/">normalize the vector</a> to a length of 1.</p>

When calling the THREE.AmbientLight constructor I can give a color as the first argument followed by a starting intensity value of the light. </p>
<p>There is also the emissive color, and the emissive intensity options that are typically found in materials that respond to light sources that can also be used to get a base amount of color. By default the emissive color is black, so often I might want to set the emissive color to something other than black. After that another option of interest would be the emissive intensity option. This emissive intensity option can be adjusted along with the intensity of the ambient light to change the base intensity of the emissive and color options of the matreial.</p>

<h2 id="11-Shadows"><a href="#11-Shadows" class="headerlink" title="11 - Shadows"></a>11 - Shadows</h2><p>For this section I will be taking a look at the use of shadows with materials. There are a lot of details to be aware of when it comes to getting these up and running with a project. There is not just what one should be aware of when it comes to materials mind you, but also the various other typical features of the project. For example there is checking if the renderer that you are using will even support shades to begin with, when t comes to that the webGl Renderer seems to do so just fine, but the shadow map setting might need to be set to true first. There are also a lot of other properties at the mesh object level, and also with the light sources that one is using as well that need to be addressed.</p>
<h3 id="11-1-Spotlight-Example-of-Shadows"><a href="#11-1-Spotlight-Example-of-Shadows" class="headerlink" title="11.1 - Spotlight Example of Shadows"></a>11.1 - Spotlight Example of Shadows</h3><p>For this example I worked out a bAsic hello world kind of example with shadows. When setting up the renderer I need to make sure shadow map is set to true for it. After that there are the castShadow and receive shadow booleans of the mesh objects that I also want to make sure are set to true as well. When it comes to the spot light that I am using there are a whole bunch of properties that I might want to adjust as well. However when it comes to the materials uses it would seem that there is not that much that I need to bother with, at least when it comes to the basics with this when using the standard material, and phong material at least. One thing that I have noticed thus far is that the material option used for an object that is casting a shadow might not matter that much, but the object that is receiving a shadow does very much matter. Although much of this has to do with the renderer, mesh, and light source objects the material used still does need to support these shadow effects as well.</p>

<h2 id="12-Using-Arrays-of-Materials-and-the-Groups-property-of-Buffer-Geometry-Objects"><a href="#12-Using-Arrays-of-Materials-and-the-Groups-property-of-Buffer-Geometry-Objects" class="headerlink" title="12 - Using Arrays of Materials and the Groups property of Buffer Geometry Objects"></a>12 - Using Arrays of Materials and the Groups property of Buffer Geometry Objects</h2><p>For this section I will not be getting more into the subject of using an <a href="/2018/05/14/threejs-mesh-material-index/">array of materials</a> rather than just one for a display object. When it comes to older versions of threejs this would involve the use of the now defunct face3 class. I will not be getting into the use of that class of course, however I am still seeing a lot of outdated threejs source code examples pop up in Google search when it comes to this so be aware of that when looking elsewhere with this.</p>
<p>The general process of doing this will not always just involving passing an array of materials and then moving on with ones life. If you are lucky the groups property is all ready set up just the way that you want it and maybe that will in fact actually be the case. However more often that not one will need to update, or even create to begin with the groups property of the geometry that is used with the over all display object.</p>
<h3 id="12-1-Cube-Example-Revisited"><a href="#12-1-Cube-Example-Revisited" class="headerlink" title="12.1 - Cube Example Revisited"></a>12.1 - Cube Example Revisited</h3><p>In the Basic Section I covered a simple example of the use of an array of materials using an instance of the Box Geometry. The Box geometry is one example of a geometry cerated with a built in geometry constructor where the groups property is set up to begin with. So demos that involve this kind of geometry often serve as a good start point for this sort of thing for that reason. With that said for this first demo on my arrays of materials section here I will once again be starting out with that, but this time I will be looping over the array of groups objects and setting the values of the material index properties of each group object.</p>
<p>So then this time I will not just be passing an array fo six materials, but rather an array of only three materials. Sense the total number of materials is less than the number of groups one way to work with this would be to set each material index value of each group to the material index value that I want fir each side.</p>

<p>There are a lot of other ways of branching off from this point such as using more than six materials and what one might want to do with that kind of situation. There is updating the material index values over time to switch to whatever material I want to use for whatever side at any given moment. However there is also increasing the point density of the box geometry and creating a whole new groups array from the ground up by leaning how to use the various buffer geometry class methods that there are to work with when it comes to this sort of thing.</p>
<h2 id="13-Fog-and-materials"><a href="#13-Fog-and-materials" class="headerlink" title="13 - Fog and materials"></a>13 - Fog and materials</h2><p>I thought that I should start a section on the <a href="/2018/04/16/threejs-fog">subject of FOG and materials</a>, and have at least one demo that I might expand on more as there is a great deal to be aware of when it comes to this subject. When it comes to the options for Fog Objects to set to the scene.fog property there are two options <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/scenes/FogExp2" target="_blank" rel="external">THREE.FogExp2</a>, and <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/scenes/Fog" target="_blank" rel="external">THREE.Fog</a>. More often than not I like to go with THREE.FogExp2 over that of THREE.Fog as I like the exponential effects rather than the similar linear effect of THREE.Fog.</p>
<h3 id="13-1-EXP2-FOG"><a href="#13-1-EXP2-FOG" class="headerlink" title="13.1 - EXP2 FOG"></a>13.1 - EXP2 FOG</h3><p>Here I have an animation loop demo of THREE.FogExp2 where I pass the color I want to use as the first argument and then a density value for the fog. I then this fog object as the value for scene.fog, and then any material that supports fog will then be effected by it such as with the mesh basic material which is what I am using in this demo here. I will also more often than not want to set the background color to that of the fig color as well as the fog will just effect materials and not much of anything else. So If I am not going to add additional mesh objects to serve as background in the scene that will also be effected by the fog I will want to set the style of my solid background to work well with what I want to do here.</p>

However there might be a situation here and there where you might want to work out some kind of custom material by writing a little bot of original GLSL code that will then be used for the the vertex for fragment shaders that are needed to <a href="/2023/01/13/threejs-shader-material/">create an instance of the THREE.ShaderMaterial</a>.</p>

Nothing fancy here at all just getting to a point where we have a solid mass of color on the screen and that is it. When it comes to this there is working out just two values of interest which is gl_position in the vertex shader, and gl_FragColor in the fragment shader.</p>

<h3 id="14-2-Uniform-values"><a href="#14-2-Uniform-values" class="headerlink" title="14.2 - Uniform values"></a>14.2 - Uniform values</h3><p>A <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Uniform_%28GLSL%29" target="_blank" rel="external">uniform value IN GLSL</a> is a global Shader variable declared with the “uniform” <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Type_Qualifier_%28GLSL%29#Storage_qualifier" target="_blank" rel="external">storage qualifier</a>. These kinds of values are values that can be passed to the shader program by the user. For example there is setting the color option, or the opacity option of the Mesh basic Material. </p>
<p>With this example then I made a custom kind of Depth Material by studying the GLSL source code of the Mesh Depth Material which is where I found out that I can use gl_FragCoord.z over the higher precision values that are used in the Depth Material. One feature that I would like to add while making this is to have a kind of base color optiin for the depth material that is then effected by the depth values.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>That covers just about everything, but I would still not go so far as to say that this post is truly comprehensive on the subject of materials in threejs. Many of these sections could still use further expansion and revilement. Also when it comes to getting into the subject of the shader material and with that what there is to work with in the shader library the sky is kind of the limit it would seem. There are all the little chunks of the shader lib to use to help add various common parts of materials to a custom material. Also there is the subject of using the Raw shader material and with that using raw GLSL code to create a material from the ground up. So yes there is a whole other language to learn when it comes to getting proficient with that.</p>
<p>This is one of my oldest blog posts on threejs that I have of course edited a number of times sense I first started it. I will of course come around to edit this post some more now and then in an effort to try my best to really do this subject justice. </p>
