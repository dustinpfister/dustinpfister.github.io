        <p>A <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/scenes/Scene" target="_blank" rel="external">Scene</a> object in <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">three.js</a> is an instance of the THREE.Scene constructor that can be used to place everything that makes up an environment in a three.js project. It can contain cameras, lights, and of course mesh objects composed of a geometry and material, along with many other types of various objects such as arrow helpers. The scene object can then be passed to a render function along with a camera to render a view of the scene from the perspective of the given camera.</p>
<p>There is a great deal of other things to cover when it comes to a scene object though, such as the background and fog properties, and the fact that it inherits from the Object3d base class which allows for things like having a whole scene re positioned, and rotated just like mesh objects, cameras and anything based off of Object3d. So in this post I will be going over at least a few details that revolve around the topic of scene objects in the java Script library known as threejs.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="The-scene-object-What-to-know-first"><a href="#The-scene-object-What-to-know-first" class="headerlink" title="The scene object What to know first"></a>The scene object What to know first</h2><p>This is an post on <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">three.js</a> and even then this is just a general post that covers just one little constructor function known as <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/scenes/Scene" target="_blank" rel="external">THREE.Scene</a>. If you are new to three.js you might want to start with <a href="/2018/04/04/threejs-getting-started/">my getting started post on three.js</a> as a starting point. </p>
<p>If you are new to javaScript in general I have wrote a few <a href="/2018/11/27/js-getting-started/">getting started type posts with javaScript</a> that might be worth checking out as there is always more to learn when it comes to java Script alone. </p>
<p>I then assume that you have at least some basic working knowledge of the basics of threejs and JavaScript, so I will not be getting into that here. However in this section I will quickly cover a few things that you might want to read up more on when it comes to getting a more solid understanding of the scene objects, and some other related topics that you show know in order to do something with a scene object.</p>

<h3 id="In-order-to-view-a-scene-you-will-want-to-known-how-to-set-up-a-renderer"><a href="#In-order-to-view-a-scene-you-will-want-to-known-how-to-set-up-a-renderer" class="headerlink" title="In order to view a scene you will want to known how to set up a renderer"></a>In order to view a scene you will want to known how to set up a renderer</h3><p>The scene object is a main object that will contain all of the objects that compose the over all scene that we are going to be looking at. However in order to view the state of one of these scene objects it is called for to use some kind of renderer as a way to view the current state of the scene object with a camera. </p>
<p>The typical render that I often go with these days as of r127 is the <a href="/2018/11/24/threejs-webglrenderer/">Web Gl renderer</a>, as browser support for web gl is now pretty good compared to the way things where a few years ago. In older versions of threejs including the ones I was using when I first wrote this post there was also the 2d canvas renderer. It is still possible to use <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/r127/examples/js/renderers" target="_blank" rel="external">some alternative renderer’s</a> which can be found in the examples folder of the threejs Github repository.</p>
<h3 id="In-order-to-use-a-renderer-with-a-scene-you-will-also-need-a-camera"><a href="#In-order-to-use-a-renderer-with-a-scene-you-will-also-need-a-camera" class="headerlink" title="In order to use a renderer with a scene you will also need a camera"></a>In order to use a renderer with a scene you will also need a camera</h3><p>In order to use the render function of a renderer I will need to pass the scene object to it, but I will also need to pass a camera to use also. There is a lot to cover when it comes to what the options are with cameras, but I typically like to just go with the <a href="/2018/04/07/threejs-camera-perspective/">perspective camera</a>. </p>
<p>The camera object can or can not be added to the scene object, but often I will add it to the scene anyway. If I add some kind of child object to the camera that I want to effect the scene such as a light source then I will have to add the camera to the scene or else those children will not be in the scene naturally.</p>
<h3 id="Mesh-objects-Geometry-Materials-and-the-Object3d-base-class"><a href="#Mesh-objects-Geometry-Materials-and-the-Object3d-base-class" class="headerlink" title="Mesh objects, Geometry, Materials, and the Object3d base class"></a>Mesh objects, Geometry, Materials, and the Object3d base class</h3><p>In order to have something to look at in a scene I am going to want to create and add at least one or more <a href="/2018/05/04/threejs-mesh/">mesh objects</a>. In order to create a mesh object I will want to have a geometry, and one or more <a href="/2018/04/30/threejs-materials/">materials</a> by which to style that geometry. </p>
<p>There is also a lot to cover when it comes to the base class of a Mesh object which is also a base class of a scene object called Object3d. For example when I call the add method of a scene object and add an object as a child of the scene object that is a method of the object3d class and not the scene class. The same add method can be used with mesh objects, cameras, groups, and anything else that is based off of object3d.</p>
<h3 id="Version-Numbers-matter-with-three-js"><a href="#Version-Numbers-matter-with-three-js" class="headerlink" title="Version Numbers matter with three.js"></a>Version Numbers matter with three.js</h3><p>When I first wrote this post I was using three.js r91, and the last time I edited this post and did some testing and editing of the source code examples I was using r135. I have made an effort of making sure I mention what version of threejs I am using when making these posts as threejs is a pretty fast moving project, and code breaking changes happen often.</p>
<h3 id="The-source-code-examples-in-this-post-are-on-Github"><a href="#The-source-code-examples-in-this-post-are-on-Github" class="headerlink" title="The source code examples in this post are on Github"></a>The source code examples in this post are on Github</h3><p>The source code examples that I am writing about in this post can be found on Github in <a href="https://github.com/dustinpfister/test_threejs/tree/master/views/forpost/threejs-scene" target="_blank" rel="external">my test threejs repository</a>.</p>
<h2 id="1-Basic-example-of-THREE-Scene"><a href="#1-Basic-example-of-THREE-Scene" class="headerlink" title="1 - Basic example of THREE.Scene"></a>1 - Basic example of THREE.Scene</h2><p>First off I will want to create the scene by just calling the THREE.Scene constructor with the new keyword, and saving the result of that to a variable. This result will be my scene object but there at least a little more to do if I want to actual see something. At a minimum beyond just having a scene object I will want to have at least some kind of mesh object to look at added to a Scene.  For now this mesh object could just be a mesh that used a geometry from one of the built in geometry constructors in three.js such as <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/geometries/BoxGeometry" target="_blank" rel="external">THREE.BoxGeometry</a>, and then I can use something like the Normal material which does not require a light source.</p>
<p>Unless I aim to do something headless with a scene and one or more mesh objects, I will also want a camera and a renderer to look at what it is that I am doing with this scene object. There are a number of options when it comes to a camera, but I typically like to go with the <a href="/2018/04/07/threejs-camera-perspective/">perspective camera</a>. In some cases I might want to add the camera to the scene, but in any case I will want to have this ready to be used with a renderer where I will pass a scene object, and a camerae which will then be used to render to a canvas element.</p>
<p>So a basic example of THREE.Scene might look something like this:</p>

<p>If I did not give a normal material when creating the mesh then by default a Mesh will use the Basic material with a random color used to paint the faces of the geometry. Of course I could create an instance of some other material, or give a color or texture to another instance of basic material that I would then give as the second argument to the Mesh constructor. However getting into materials in depth might be a bot off topic, I have wrote a a post on materials in general anyway so I do not care to repeat that all here. I will however be getting into the properties of THREE.Scene including the material override property, more on that later.</p>
<h2 id="2-Adding-Fog-to-a-scene"><a href="#2-Adding-Fog-to-a-scene" class="headerlink" title="2 - Adding Fog to a scene"></a>2 - Adding Fog to a scene</h2><p>A property of interest in a scene instance is the <a href="/2018/04/16/threejs-fog/">scene.fog Property</a> which can be used to add a fog effect to that will effect mesh objects that use materials that are effected by a fog. When adding a fog I typically keep the background color, and the color of the fog the same, and stick to using materials that will work with a fog like that of the standard material.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of fog that can be added to a scene in three.js which are <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/scenes/Fog" target="_blank" rel="external">Fog</a>, and <a href="https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/scenes/FogExp2" target="_blank" rel="external">FogExp2</a>. The regular Fog constructor will add a fog that works in a linear way, while the FogExp2 constructor works in an exponential way.</p>
<h2 id="3-Changing-the-background-of-the-Scene-with-Scene-background"><a href="#3-Changing-the-background-of-the-Scene-with-Scene-background" class="headerlink" title="3 - Changing the background of the Scene with Scene.background"></a>3 - Changing the background of the Scene with Scene.background</h2><p>It goes without saying that an important part of the scene instance is the background property. By default the value of the background is null but there are a number of kinds of values that can be set to this background property to have differing kinds of backgrounds for a scene object. The easy option is to just have a solid color background, but a texture as well as cube texture are other options if you want to get fancy with things.</p>
<h3 id="3-1-Basic-static-color-background-example"><a href="#3-1-Basic-static-color-background-example" class="headerlink" title="3.1 - Basic static color background example"></a>3.1 - Basic static color background example</h3><p>The easy option is to just set a simple solid color for the background of the scene. For this the best option might be to go with the THREE.Color class as a way to create and return a color object to set to the scene.background property. When doing so I can give three numbers in the range of 0 to 1 for the red, green, and blue color channels. There are a number of other options in the color class for setting a desired color, be sure to check out my <a href="/2021/05/03/threejs-color/">post on the THREE.Color constructor</a> to get a better idea of what all the options are with this class.</p>

<h3 id="3-2-Canvas-texture-example-of-background"><a href="#3-2-Canvas-texture-example-of-background" class="headerlink" title="3.2 - Canvas texture example of background"></a>3.2 - Canvas texture example of background</h3><p>Apart from setting a solid color for the background another option would be to use a simple 2d texture for a background. There are of source a whole lot of options for this sort of thing when it comes to loading a texture in terms of an external file, or generating one with javaScript code. For this example I am using a <a href="/2018/04/17/threejs-canvas-texture/">canvas element as a way to create a texture</a> with a little java Script code rather than loading an external image assets. In any case the image width and height should be a power of two, and while I am at it I might want to also adjust the offset and repeat Vector2 instance values to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52624261/three-js-scaling-background-image-to-fit-window-without-stretching-it" target="_blank" rel="external">adjust the aspect ration of the image that is used with the background</a>.</p>

<h3 id="3-3-Cube-texture-background-example"><a href="#3-3-Cube-texture-background-example" class="headerlink" title="3.3 - Cube texture background example"></a>3.3 - Cube texture background example</h3><p>I have written a <a href="/2018/04/22/threejs-cube-texture/">post on how to used a cube texture</a> in which I get into how to go about doing just that in detail. However I will cover a JavaScript solution for doing this sort of thing here to save you the trip. The easy part is just simply creating a cube texture, to do so I just need six images, or in this case use the same image for all six sides. In any case after the easy part is done the hard part is getting the textures to look right rather than having a look where it is obvious that we are in a box sort of speak.</p>
<p>This JavaScript solution for resolving this issue seems to work okay, but I have not battle tested it as of this writing. Again you might want to check out my post on cube texture as I might have more up to date example there that I have not covered here just yet. However the genera idea is to start out with one or more grids that have my raw seamless image data, and then run it threw a function that will remap the color data to make it look the way that it should.</p>

<p>In the above demo I created a simple scene with a few instances of Mesh that each use a different material and or settings for the material. By setting an instance of THREE.MeshDepthMaterial as the value of Scene.overrideMaterial, all the other materials are ignored and the depth material is just used for everything.</p>
<p>This can be useful if you want to have a feature that allows for doing something like setting everything in the scene to wire frame mode.</p>

However simply put, like a lot of things in three.js the Scene Class inherits from the Object3D class. This Object3d class gives THREE.Scene properties and methods like Object3D.position, Object3D.rotation and Object3D.add which can be used to add additional objects to the scene.</p>
<p>There is a lot that could be written about this, and how it applies the a scene object, but one interesting thing is that if I play with the instance of <a href="/2018/04/15/threejs-vector3/">Vector3</a> that is stored in the position property of my scene instance this will change the position of the whole Scene, and everything in it that is added relative to the scene.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>That is all that I have to say about these scene of a three.js project example for now. There is a great deal more to write about when it comes to a scene in three.js, but much of that might branch off into just about everything with the library actually. A scene is a major part of any three.js project, along with other vital components such as a camera, and a renderer all of which just about every three.js example I have made includes each of those.</p>
<p>The best way to learn more about the THREE.Scene constructor and everything else that is used with it would be to just start making some actual projects of some kind with three.js and just start learning as one goes. With that said I have some simple project examples to start off with in my <a href="/2021/02/19/threejs-examples/">post on three.js examples</a> that might be worth checking out when it comes to getting some ideas for actual projects of some kind.</p>
